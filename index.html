    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <P>
        Hello, my name is Henri Alvarez. I enjoy playing video games and playing Chess online. A few of my favorite games consist of Rocket League, Dead by Daylight, and Mordhau. I play Chess to constantly activate my brain to think analytically and because I enjoy the various positions chess can bring life to. I also like to watch anime as my go-to shows. My top anime of all time are Bleach,  Hunter X Hunter, and Dragonball Super. The current anime I am watching is called Jujutsu Kaisen. 
    </P>

    <p>
        I previously lived with my family in Chicago. Now my family and I have been living in Romeoville for about 4 years now. It is a convenient location nearby Lewis University. My major is in Computer Science to become a software engineer. One of the reasons why I want to become a software engineer is because I played many games when I was younger and I still continue to play online with friends to this day. I also enjoy building concepts into the physical world and challenging myself to do better. In software engineering, I know that I will constatnly have new material to learn and explore. For these reasons, I am excited to be joining the world of technology.

    <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite hobby is to draw from what comes to mind or from a picture/drawing that I like. I tend to draw anime characters from previous anime that I have watched. I have drawn Dragonball Z, Naruto, Fairy Tail, and many other anime characters. Recently I have gone to Pinterest to search up for random anime characters and draw them while making adjustments to the drawings if my imagination is thinking of something to include or adjust to the original image.
